# Sprecher-Network

Sprecher-Network is a PyTorch-based neural network that leverages custom spline layers to iteratively approximate functions.

## Overview
This project implements a neural network with custom spline layers using PyTorch. The network is trained layer-by-layer to learn complex functions and includes visualization tools for both the target function and the network's output.

## Installation

1. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the training and visualization script:
   ```
   python snH9.py
   ```
